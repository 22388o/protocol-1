# NFTlend.xyz

The end of searching for liquidity. 

## Design statement

How might we improve liquidity for NFT owners, so that they have immediate access to funds without having to first find a lender, agree to a deal, or sell below market?

## Overview

NFTlend is building the first automated market maker for instant, permissionless NFT-backed loans.

- **Borrowers** escrow NFTs to instantly access over-collateralized, fixed-term loans priced at the project floor. 

- **Lenders** deposit assets into the lending pool to receive yield generated from borrower interest payments. 

- **Liquidators** repay any loan defaults (those expired or undercollateralized) to purchase the underlying NFT at a discount.

## Live dApp 

Deployed on Ropsten and IPFS: [ropsten.nftlend.xyz](https://ropsten.nftlend.xyz/#/).

Note that test `DAI`, `USDC` or `WETH` is required to interact with the protocol. 

Contact me on Twitter [@niftrr](https://twitter.com/niftrr) with your Ethereum address and I will send you some.

## Protocol system design

### System diagram

![System Diagram](assets/nftlend-system-diagram.png?raw=true "System diagram")

### Summary

- **Lending Pool** is the main contract of the protocol exposing all user interaction endpoints; `deposit`, `withdraw`, `borrow`, `repay` and `liquidate`.

- **Collateral Manager** contract handles the escrow of NFTs and loan creation.

- **nTokens** are interest-bearing derivative tokens that are minted and burned upon the `deposit` and `withdraw` of asset tokens to / from the `Lending Pool` at a 1:1 ratio.

- **debtTokens** are non-transferable derivative tokens that are minted and burned upon the `borrow` and `repay` of loans to the `Lending Pool` a 1:1 ratio with the asset token repayment amount. It is the ratio of `debtTokens` to `nTokens`, updated at every user interaction, that is used to calculate the interest generated by the protocol.

- **NFT Pricing Oracles** are used to update NFT project floor prices, to price new loans and signal if the underlying loan collateral price falls below threshold for liquidation.

- **Token Pricing Oracles** are used to calculate exchange rates from the `NFT Pricing Oracles`, priced in ETH, to other loaned assets; DAI and USDC.

- **Libraries** contain reusable code, refactored from the protocol to save gas.

- **Configurator** is the admin contract used to set / update protocol variables.

## Local development

### Protocol

Follow the instructions in [v1-core/README.md](v1-core/README.md).

### Interface

Follow the instruction in [interface/README.md](interface/README.md).

## Next steps

* Connect with [Opensea Chainlink external adapter](https://github.com/niftrr/opensea-cl-ea) for NFT floor prices. (Note: external adapter development already complete and being supported by node operators).
* Connect to [Chainlink data feeds](https://chain.link/data-feeds) for price-feed integration. 
* Add logic to generage interest payment accrual to lenders.
* Update liquidate function to trigger a timed auction with a feature to allow the original owner to purchase back their deposited price at the cost of the outstanding debt plus a fee; to provide better protection and compensation for NFT owners during liquidation events. 
* Add flash loan functionality.
* Audit smart contracts.
* Update the Interface in terms of UX, with full test coverage.
